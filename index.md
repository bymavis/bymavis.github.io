<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a senoir research scientist at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/). I received my Ph.D. from [Tsinghua Univeristy](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in June 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yong Jiang and [Prof. Shu-tao Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=koAXTXgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I was also co-supervised by [Prof. Yisen Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uMWPDboAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Tsinghua University in June 2017. I joined Tencent in July 2022. Before that, I was an intern in the [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/zh/index) and Tencent Zhuque Lab from July to November 2019 and February to June 2022. 

My general research interest is **convex/non-convex optimization** and **robust machine learning** -- with a special focus on building ML systems which are data-efficient and robust, especially for commercial foundation models.
