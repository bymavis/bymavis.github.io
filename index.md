<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a senoir research scientist at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/). I received my Ph.D. from [Tsinghua Univeristy](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2022.06, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yong Jiang and [Prof. Shu-tao Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=koAXTXgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I was also co-supervised by [Prof. Yisen Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uMWPDboAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Tsinghua University in 2017.06.  

My general research interest is **non-convex optimization** and **robust machine learning** -- with a special focus on building robust and trustworthy systems which are also energy- and data-efficient.
